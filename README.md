# Real-Time Audio Noise Reduction System (MATLAB)

This project implements a real-time adaptive noise reduction system using MATLAB. It uses techniques like BPSK modulation, NLMS filtering, Wiener filtering, and wavelet denoising.

## Features
- Real-time audio input and processing
- NLMS and Wiener filtering
- Spectral subtraction and wavelet denoising
- GUI controls for live playback and SNR display

## How to Run
1. Open `realTimeProcessing.m` in MATLAB
2. Ensure required toolboxes are installed
3. Run the script and allow microphone access

## Toolboxes Required
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- DSP System Toolbox
- Communications Toolbox
