# noise-reduction-in-audio-communication
This MATLAB project implements a real-time audio noise reduction system using adaptive filtering techniques like NLMS and Wiener filtering, along with spectral subtraction. It supports real-time microphone input, audio playback, and a GUI for visualization and SNR monitoring. Designed for clean audio communication.
